# Rental Car Revenue Management Examples
This repo contains a set of revenue management (RM) examples applied to the rental car industry. It provides a series of scenarios of increasing complexity, beginning with a single-location rental car setup and progressing to one that supports multiple locations with truck-based car transfer, dynamic prices, and fluctuating demand. These examples focus on the capacity allocation aspect of RM and were developed for a hands-on workshop given to [Optimization4All](https://optimization4all.com/) on December 3, 2025.
